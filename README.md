# Smart-City-Parking-Optimization-System-

Week 1 report:
This week focused on setting the technical foundations of the project. A dedicated repository was created to host the source code and documentation. The overall system architecture was designed, outlining the main components such as data collection from parking spots, a backend service for processing and storage, and a frontend client for user interaction. Initial decisions were made about how different modules will communicate and how the system can scale as more parking locations and users are added. This sets up a clear structure for starting implementation in the following weeks.
